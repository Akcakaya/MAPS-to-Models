# MAPS-to-Models
Methods for Developing Population Models with Mark-Recapture Data from the MAPS program

`MAPS-to-Models` is an R script that provides functions to analyze 
data from marked individuals (mark-recapture data) to develop a 
stage-structured, stochastic, density dependent population model.

For more information, please see Ryu et al. (2015), who describe the methods and demonstrate their use with data from the MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivarship) program (hence "MAPS" in `MAPS-to-Models`).

The program allows estimating survival rates; fecundities; density dependence in survival rate; density dependence in fecundity; temporal variability in survival rate; temporal variability in fecundity.


`MAPS-to-Models` The program creates the following

sensitivity analysis (GSA) of demographic models created via the 
[RAMAS GIS](http://ramas.com/software.htm) Software. `demgsa` includes 
functions to make easier each major step of a GSA:
